# Licensing

## Each repository should include a licence file

This should be called `LICENCE` or `LICENCE.md`. "License" is the U.S. English spelling.

GitHub.com will still show licence details for the British English spelling.

## Use MIT

At GDS we use the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Make sure the licence content is included in full, including the title "The MIT License", so that readers are quickly able to see what licence is being used.

## Copyright notice

The Copyright is Crown Copyright; you can put "Government Digital Service" in brackets.

e.g. `Copyright (c) 2017 Crown Copyright (Government Digital Service)`.

The year should be the year the code was first published. Where the code is continually updated with significant changes, the year can be shown as a period from first to most recent update (e.g. 2015-2017).

For more information on copyright notices, see the [UK Copyright Service fact sheet](http://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p03_copyright_notices).

## Example

There is a good example of a licence in the [pay-adminusers](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-adminusers/blob/master/LICENCE) repo.
